1,Infections,COVID-19 Infections ,"While COVID-19 was initially limited to China, the virus quickly spread across the world.  At the end of January 2020, there were just under 10,000 confirmed cases.  By the end of February, the number of confirmed cases jumped eight-fold to 85,000 due to the virus spreading outside of China.  The outlook worsened further in March as the infection total jumped to 800,000 cases and more countries began reporting their first cases.   Due to the rapid spread of the virus, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11th.  The United States followed suit and declared a national emergency two days later.   While governmental response to the virus increased significantly in many countries, subsequent months have also reflected large numbers of infections, though the growth rate was slower from May - early July.  While many countries have stabilized the impact of COVID, a significant jump in infections have been reported in July."
